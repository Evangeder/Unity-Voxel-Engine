# Unity Voxel Engine
As the name implies - this is a voxel engine for Unity.
It uses both Greedy Mesh algorithm for optimization of classic voxels, and Marching Cubes for smooth ones.

Project is set up using HDRP. The shaders are made exclusively to work with this code.

# It is outdated
After a long time of working on this project i decided to release it to public so you can tinker around with it. I haven't updated it really for like 3 years or something.
